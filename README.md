# Marginal Revolution - a web scraping test

I'm building this to learn how to perform some web-scraping based on the post [here](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/07/a-test-of-marginal-revolution-political-bias.html).

If I can make the webscraping work effectively I'll pull some graphs to understand trends over time, or if I get really ambitious I'll try to train an NLP classifier based on the previous work to further categorize the links as left/right/neutral or possibly by category (eduaction, politics etc)
